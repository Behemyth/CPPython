= Fixtures

Fixtures can be accessed by installing the optional `pytest` module, `cppython.pytest`.

== Dynamic Fixtures

With the pytest feature of `pytest_generate_tests` we register multiple dynamic fixtures for collecting test data, both for plugins and for the test suite itself.


=== `build_<directory>` Fixture

* Discovered from `tests/build/<directory>`
* The contents of the directory are copied to a temporary directory
